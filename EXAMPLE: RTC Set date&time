/*    READ_ME!!!!
   As we are using a PCF8523 chip to control the RTC, we need to include the 'RTClib' library, 
  then include "RTC_PC8523 rtc;" 
  There are different commands included in this example, but the current example will upload the
  current time and date from when the code is VERIFIED. Any gap in the tine of verification and upload
  will result in a gap of the real time and the time recorded on the RTC.
  ADDITIONALLY, it is important that the command "rtc.adjust" adjust be commented out once the desired 
  time and date are set. Failure to do so will initialize the original time and date at every reset 
  of the arduino.
